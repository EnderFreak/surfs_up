# surfs_up Challenge
Module 9 - Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Purpose
W. Avy is looking to invest in my surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii selling surfboards and ice-cream. Before investing in the shop, he is concerned about the weather temperature trends and wants temperature data especifically for June and December in Oahu, to get a better idea if the shop business is sustainable year-round, and if this is a good business decision.
